# Neuro-Final
Final project for MBB 496 computational neurology

Using data from a cross-disrder study, present SNPs are recorded in patients with autism, ADD, MDD (manic depression disorder), BIP (), and schizophrenia

Primary analysis and PCA extraced SNPs with low pvallues and extreme (log10 scale) odds-ratio

Performed regression analysis (linear and random forest) to evaluate for any corrolation between the chromosomal number of SNP, the reference and mutated allele bases and the odds-ratio.
non were found
